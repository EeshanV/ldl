## Overview
This project is a collection of Linux kernel modules developed on the Raspberry Pi. Each module is designed to help deepen understanding of Linux kernel concepts.

## Project Structure
Each module resides in its own folder, containing the source code, Makefile, and any additional resources required for building and testing.

### Completed Modules
| Module Folder                 | Description                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Hello_World`                 | A simple module that logs "Hello, world!" to the kernel log, serving as an introduction to module creation. |
| `Dev_Number`                  | Module demonstrating how to obtain a device number and interact with device files.              |
| `Read_Write`                  | Module that automatically creates device files for easy access and manipulation of device data. |

*Additional modules will be added over time as the project progresses.*
